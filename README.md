# Pewlett_Hackards
Pewlett Hackard’s research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of the employees from that period are six CSV files.
The project takes on designing tables to answers questions from the data in the files by using data modelling, data engineering and data analysis.

Data Modeling:
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. 

Data Engineering:
•	Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
•	Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

Data Analysis:
Answer the following questions from the database:
1.	List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
2.	List employees who were hired in 1986.
3.	List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
4.	List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5.	List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
6.	List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
7.	List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8.	In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


Further Analysis:
1)	Import the SQL database into Pandas
2)	Create a bar chart of average salary by title.
